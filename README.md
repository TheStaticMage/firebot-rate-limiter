# Firebot Rate Limiter

## Introduction

This is a rate limiter to prevent particular effects from running too frequently in Firebot. This is primarily intended to help avoid abuse, but it can also be used to implement advanced logic around cooldowns, maximum invocations per stream, etc.

Some of the things you can use this rate limiter to help with include:

- Limiting the number of times a user can run a command repeatedly in a short period of time
- Implementing cooldowns and/or usage limits on effects for which Firebot does not natively support cooldowns and/or usage limits

This script supplies the following:

- The `Rate Limiter: Check Request` effect, which is available for all events and effect lists. This is capable of stopping the effect list and/or setting effect outputs so you can take action.
- The `Rate Limit Exceeded` event, so you can run effects when rate limits are exceeded (this is optional and intended for advanced users)
- The ability to configure shared rate limiter buckets that are accessible from multiple effects

### How does the rate limiter work?

To understand how a rate limiter works in general, visualize the following:

- You have a pack of cookies and a bowl that has 20 marbles in it.
- In order to can eat a cookie, you need to take 5 marbles out of the bowl. (If there are fewer than 5 marbles in the bowl, you cannot have a cookie.)
- Every minute, you may replace 1 marble into the bowl, so long as there are never more than 20.

At the start, the bowl is full of marbles, and you can scarf down 4 cookies right away if you want to (20 / 5 = 4). But after that, you will have to wait a bit for there to be enough marbles in the bowl for you to have another cookie. If you eat a cookie immediately when there are enough marbles are available, you will have one cookie every 5 minutes after your initial burst. However, if you take a walk, the bowl slowly fills up with marbles, and you can once again eat several cookies when you get back.

This illustration demonstrates the [token bucket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket) algorithm -- the bowl is the _bucket_ and the marbles are the _tokens_. You will configure the parameters of your bucket, such as how many tokens are present at the start and how fast tokens are replenished. You will then add the "Rate Limiter: Check Request" effect to the effect list of activities you want to limit, like running a command or sending a TTS message. This effect can stop the execution of the rest of the effect list if the limits are exceeded, or you can use its outputs to make decisions in future conditional effects.

The [tutorial](/doc/tutorial.md) implements the "cookies and marbles" example in Firebot.

## Installation

The script needs to be installed like any other Firebot startup script.

For detailed instructions, consult: [Installation](/doc/installation.md)

## Examples

### Tutorial

The [tutorial](/doc/tutorial.md) implements the "cookies and marbles" example from above.

### Cooldown

:bulb: _Many Firebot components support cooldowns. If you can achieve what you need via native Firebot functionality, you generally should. This example is provided for educational purposes only._

### Limit per stream

:bulb: _Many Firebot components support limits. If you can achieve what you need via native Firebot functionality, you generally should. This example is provided for educational purposes only._

### Persist cooldowns across streams / Firebot restarts

:bulb: _I do not believe that Firebot can natively do this._

- Create an advanced bucket in the RATE LIMITER tab from the left frame
- Check the "Persist bucket data across Firebot restarts" and "Fill across Firebot restarts" boxes.

To make sure I don't miss chat messages, I had Firebot configured to play a sound when someone posts a chat message on Twitch. I set up the rate limiter so that this sound plays at most once every 5 seconds so it's not playing the sound continuously during periods of high activity. That setup looked like this:

- Event: **Chat Message (Twitch)**
- Filters:
  - **Viewers Roles** / Doesn't include / Streamer
  - **Viewers Roles** / Doesn't include / Stream Bot
- Effects:
  - **Rate Limiter: Check Request**: Bucket size = 5, Refill rate = 1, Key = Global, Stop effect execution if limit exceeded
  - **Play sound**: A "ding" sound routed only to my headphones

Recently I set up the [Firebot Kick Integration](https://github.com/TheStaticMage/firebot-mage-kick-integration) which has a separate chat event for Kick. However, if I just copied this same setup to the Kick event, the chat notification sounds would not be coordinated with each other. To address this, I can use an advanced bucket and the "Rate Limit Approved" event.

1. Ensure that advanced buckets are enabled. If you see a RATE LIMITER option in the left frame of Firebot, you're good. Otherwise, go to Settings > Scripts > Manage Startup Scripts, click Edit next to Rate Limiter, check Enable Advanced Buckets, and save. You may need to restart Firebot to get the RATE LIMITER option to show up after enabling it for the first time.

2. From the left frame, under "Custom", click on RATE LIMITER.

3. Add a new bucket with these settings: Start Tokens = 5, Max Tokens = 5, Refill Rate = 1, and none of the other options checked. Save this bucket. (This is one allowed execution per 5 seconds.)

4. For this step, you may create a new **Chat Message (Twitch)** event, or modify an existing event. In either case, add the **Rate Limiter: Check Request** effect with these settings: Bucket Type = Advanced, Bucket = _the bucket you created in step 3_, Key = Global, Tokens required = 5. From the options, check the _Trigger the 'Rate Limit Approved' event if approved_ box. (Note: You do NOT put the "Play Sound" effect in this list. We'll add that in a bit.)

5. Repeat the previous step for any additional events that you want to use this shared rate limit.

6. Create a new event of type **Rate Limit Approved**. Add a filter: **Rate Limiter Bucket** = _the bucket you created in step 3_. And then add any effect(s) -- in my case, it was the "Play Sound" effect, but this can be whatever you want.

Now, whenever _either_ of the two trigger events happens, the same 5 second rate limit will apply. As an added bonus, you have only defined your "Play Sound" effect in one place, so if you add additional trigger events, you will effectively be using the same effect list to handle it.

Contributions are welcome via [Pull Requests](https://github.com/TheStaticMage/firebot-rate-limiter/pulls). I _strongly suggest_ that you contact me before making significant changes, because I'd feel really bad if you spent a lot of time working on something that is not consistent with my vision for the project.

## FAQ

### How is this different from cooldowns or maximum usage counts?

Cooldowns and maximum usage counts are special cases of rate limits and can be modeled by this rate limiter if you want to. The rate limiter allows more flexibility (as noted in the [Examples](#examples)) that goes beyond the basic cooldowns and maximum usage counts supported by Twitch and Firebot. However, if you can do everything you need with functionality that is natively present in Firebot, then you should do so!
