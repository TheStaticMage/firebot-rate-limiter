## Installation

The script needs to be installed like any other Firebot startup script:

1. From the latest [Release](https://github.com/TheStaticMage/firebot-rate-limiter/releases), download `Firebot-Rate-Limiter-<version>.js` into your Firebot scripts directory (File &gt; Open Data Folder, then select the "scripts" directory).

    :warning: If you are upgrading from a prior version, delete any older versions of this script.

2. Enable custom scripts in Firebot (Settings &gt; Scripts).

3. Add the `Firebot-Rate-Limiter-<version>.js` script that you just added as a startup script (Settings &gt; Scripts &gt; Manage Startup Scripts &gt; Add New Script).

    :warning: If you are upgrading from a prior version, delete any references to the older versions.

4. Restart Firebot.

After installation, it will not be immediately apparent that you have installed the script. However, the following resources will now be available:

- The **Rate Limiter: Check Request** effect
- The **Rate Limit Exceeded**
