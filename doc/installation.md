## Installation: Plugin

1. Enable custom scripts in Firebot (Settings > Scripts) if you have not already done so.
2. From the latest [Release](https://github.com/TheStaticMage/firebot-rate-limiter/releases), download `Firebot-Rate-Limiter-<version>.js` into your Firebot scripts directory (File > Open Data Folder, then select the "scripts" directory).
3. Go to Settings > Scripts > Manage Startup Scripts > Add New Script and add the `Firebot-Rate-Limiter-<version>.js` script.
4. Restart Firebot. (The plugin will _not_ be loaded until you actually restart Firebot.)

After installation, the following resources will now be available:

- The **Rate Limiter: Check Request** effect
- The **Rate Limit Exceeded**
